      <h3>Mercutio</h3>

      <p>Recently taking over the position as leader of Clan Tonberry, the guild of adventurers in Ashtwall, Mercutio has been hard at work cleaning up the mess left by his predecessor. Rooting out corruption, and pruning less than stellar members is
        always an arduous task, but one that he has excelled at thus far.</p>

      <h3>Thata Ta'yuun</h3>
      <p>Thata Ta'yuun, the lavender-furred Miqo'te brawler that our heroes have run across on more than one occasion. Her motivations remain unclear, and her allegiances are questionable, but if one thing is for certain, there are none so far who
        can
        stand up to the sheer brutality and efficiency of her fighting style.</p>
